# cubejump

Welcome to Cubejump!

You can click [HERE](http://www.rickyeh.com/cubejump/) to play.

This is a small game I made to test out the Phaser library.

It is similar to many other sidescrolling jumper games like Geometry Dash and The Impossible Game.

Either press play, or select endless mode.

Press up or tap the screen to jump once, and tap again in mid air to do a double jump.

If you have any feedback, feel free to drop me a message.
